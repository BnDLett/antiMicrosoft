# Anti-Microsoft Connections
A plugin that prevents Microsoft IPs from connecting to a server.

# Note:
As of now, this is still in development. There is quite literally no actual code in the Main.java file. This repository
was only uploaded in this unfinished state for the sake of me having the repository ready in the case that I decide to
work on it from a location that is remote relative to my main desktop.
