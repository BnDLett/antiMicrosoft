# Anti-Microsoft Connections
A plugin that prevents Azure IPs from connecting to a server.

# How to install
1. Ensure that your Mindustry server is ready. In the root directory of your Mindustry server (it will contain the
"run_server.bat", "mydata.json", and "run_server.sh" files), make sure that the "config" folder exists. If it doesn't,
then run the "run_server.bat" file if you're on Windows or the "run_server.sh" file if you're on Linux. There may be
a different way to launch your server relative to the methods described here, so if there is, then launch it that way.
This will generate the `config/mods` folder tree.
2. Download the .jar for the latest (or more stable) version of this plugin. Whether you want the most stable or the 
latest version is entirely up to your needs. However, if you just want it to work, then I'd recommend the most stable
.jar file. You can find which versions are the most stable in the list shown below is this README.md file.
3. Cut or copy the installed .jar file into the `config/mods` directory. If you do not know how to get there, then go to
the root of your Mindustry server, open the `config` folder, and then open the `mods` folder.
4. Run the server and ensure that it is working. If it isn't working, then open an issue in this GitHub repository.
